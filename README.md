# mdBook-style Ayu for GitHub

Based on mdBook's [variables.css](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/blob/59f2a9bf4ed62f7ad37ff8a14887886ca16ef576/src/theme/css/variables.css) and [ayu-highlight.css](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/blob/59f2a9bf4ed62f7ad37ff8a14887886ca16ef576/src/theme/ayu-highlight.css), which are based off of the Ayu theme;  
original by Dempfi (<https://github.com/dempfi/ayu>).
